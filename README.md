# Landing Page

## Description

This is Project 2 in Foundations in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The primary goal of this project is to grow more comfortable with HTML and CSS--in particular, elements such as flexbox. 
This project centered around the task of creating a landing page using these tools. To this end, a sample layout was provided [(as pictured here)](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png). This layout need not be copied exactly, but for the purposes of this exercise, I opted to attempt its recreation as closely as possible.

## Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Improvements

In the future, I would like to improve upon this landing page with tools I gather through the rest of Fundamentals (and perhaps beyond). Namely, I would like to:  
- Adjust the layout to my own design, using other media
- Streamline the CSS for better optimization, where possible (or, at least employ better practices)
- Add small element animation on hover/etc
- Account for mobile responsiveness
